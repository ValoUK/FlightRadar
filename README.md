# FlightRadar

This is just to play around with adsbexchange database. This project is meant to display all the aircrafts flying over a specific location (given a latitude and longitude in degrees and south/north east/west boundaries in degrees)

The software will be able to plot the route of each aircraft flying over that specified perimeter

# Notes 

Eventually, I would also like to use that tool to try to get historical averaged departure/arrival routes around UK airports (or, any airports, really)
